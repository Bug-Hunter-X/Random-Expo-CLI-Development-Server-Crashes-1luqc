While working with Expo CLI, I encountered a peculiar issue where the development server would randomly crash without any apparent error messages in the terminal.  This happened inconsistently, making debugging challenging. The application itself would function correctly until the server abruptly stopped. No specific code triggered this, leading me to believe it was a system resource or Expo CLI issue.
