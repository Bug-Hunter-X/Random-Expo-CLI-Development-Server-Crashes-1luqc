# Random Expo CLI Development Server Crashes

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo CLI development server crashes randomly without providing any error messages in the terminal. The application code functions correctly until the server unexpectedly stops.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the development server; it may crash at any time without warning. No consistent pattern or code snippet triggers this crash. 

## Potential Causes

This issue might be linked to:

* System resource constraints (memory, CPU)
* Expo CLI internal errors or bugs
* Conflicting packages or dependencies

## Solution (expoBugSolution.js)

While a permanent solution requires addressing the root cause (which may be outside of your control), you can improve the debugging experience by increasing the verbosity of the Expo CLI logs and possibly employing more resilient error handling within your application.

Suggested steps:

- Upgrade Expo CLI to the latest version
- Check system resources (Memory, CPU)
- Restart your machine
- Try a different project, to rule out issues within the application
