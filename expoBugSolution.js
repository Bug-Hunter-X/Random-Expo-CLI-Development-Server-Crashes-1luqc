// Improved logging to get more info on the error
console.log('Starting Expo Development Server...');
expo.start().catch((error) => {
  console.error('Expo development server crashed:', error);
  //Consider adding a more advanced error handling mechanism that logs to a file or monitoring service
});

//In your application (if there are asynchronous operations that might cause problems, consider using try/catch blocks for more resilient error handling.  This is not a guaranteed solution for the Expo server crashes but may prevent some related crashes within the app.)
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('someurl');
    // Handle success
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
    // Handle error
  }
}

//This file just provides a place to start debugging, the actual fix would most likely involve a deeper examination of system resources, debugging the expo cli itself, or possible a conflict within dependencies.
